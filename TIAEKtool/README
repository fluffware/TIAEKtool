This is a tool to build a preset system for PLC-programs written using Siemens TIA Portal.
It connects to TIA Portal using TIA Openness.

All generated DBs are created in the "Preset" block-group.
The DBs that store the presets are called "sDB_Preset_<group>" where <group> is given in the preset annotation.
Two code blocks are also generated for each these are named "PresetStore_<group>" and "PresetSet_<group>"

To define which tags can have preset values specially formated comments are used.
The general format for an annotaion in a comment is:
@{<annotaion type><annotaion data>}
<annotaion type> may contain ASCII alphanumerics and '_'. First character can not be a digit.

A comment may contain multiple annotations. Any text outside annotations is ignored.

The available annotaions are:
@{preset [group]: <description>}
If the group is omitted then i defaults to "main". The decription is a text suitable to present to the user.

@{preset_default <default value>}
Default value for this preset.

@{preset_nostore}
No code to store the value is generated.
