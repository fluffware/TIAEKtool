This is a tool to build a preset system for PLC-programs written using Siemens TIA Portal.
It connects to TIA Portal using TIA Openness.



All presets belong to a group. If now group is given explicitly the group is "main". In the following <group> should be replaced with the specific group name.


Two type are generated for each group called "PresetValueType_<group>" and PresetEnableType_<group>.
"PresetValueType_<group>" is a struct containing values for all presets. The first level of members are the names of the global DBs that contain the presets.
"PresetEnableType_<group>" has a bool for each preset indicating wether it should be recalled or not.

All generated DBs are created in the "Preset" block-group.
Two code blocks are generated for each group are named "PresetStore_<group>" and "PresetRecall_<group>".
"PresetStore_<group>" copies values from the preset tags into a struct of type "PresetValueType_<group>".
"PresetRecall_<group>" copies values from a struct of type "PresetValueType_<group>" to the various tags, but only if the corresponding enable bit is set.


To define which tags can have preset values specially formated comments are used.
The general format for an annotaion in a comment is:
@{<annotaion type><annotaion data>}
<annotaion type> may contain ASCII alphanumerics and '_'. First character can not be a digit.

A comment may contain multiple annotations. Any text outside annotations is ignored.

The available annotaions are:
@{preset [group]: <description>}
If the group is omitted then i defaults to "main". The description is a text suitable to present to the user.

@{preset_default <default value>}
Default value for this preset.

@{preset_nostore}
Don't generate code to store the value.

@{preset_unit <unit>}
Unit for this preset

@{preset_precision}
Number of digits after decimal point for real numbers. Default is 0.
